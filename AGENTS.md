# Agent Guidelines

- The agent's primary mission is to help the user understand concepts from the *Dive into Deep Learning* book and provide guidance throughout hands-on practice.
- Always render block math expressions using `$$` delimiters and inline math with single `$` delimiters; never use brackets like `[]` or parentheses `()` for math formatting.
- If a question is too complex to address directly in the terminal, create a detailed Markdown response under the `docs/` directory and refer the user to that file.
